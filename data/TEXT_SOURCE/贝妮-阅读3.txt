My name is Lucy. There are many rules in my life. I think these rules are important for me. At home, I can't play with my pet dog for more than half an hour. I think it is good for my study because I can have more time to study. I must make the bed after I get up. And I must clean my
room every day. So my bedroom is always clean and tidy. My mother says keeping my room tidy is good for my health.
I study at No. 3 Middle School. At our school, we also have some rules. We can't be late for school. So we must arrive at school on time. We must get to school before half past seven in the morning. We need to wear the school uniforms every day. In class, we have to be quiet. We can't listen to music. We can't eat in the classroom. We must eat in the dining hall. After class, we can't run in the hallways.
Do you have rules in your life? Tell me about them.
