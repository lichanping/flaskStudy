I am Peter. My family and I move to a new house. In my room, the books are always in the bookcase. My model cars are always there, too. My
sports things are always in the box under the bed. My schoolbag is always on the chair next to the table. I clean my room three times a week.
I have a brother. His name is John. His room is always in a mess. His books are everywhere. They are on the bed, on the desk and under the
chair. His toys are on the bed. His jacket is on the chair. Where is his schoolbag? Oh, it's under the bed. Our parents say, “John, come in. Look
at your room. You must learn to be tidy. ”

我是Peter。我和我的家人搬到了一所新房子。 在我的房间里，书总是放在书架上。 我的模型车也总是在那里。 我的运动装备总是放在床底下的盒子里。
我的书包总是放在桌子旁边的椅子上。 我每周打扫我的房间三次。
我有一个弟弟。他叫John。 他的房间总是乱七八糟的。 他的书随处可见。 它们在床上，桌子上，椅子底下。 他的玩具在床上。 他的夹克挂在椅子上。
他的书包在哪里？ 哦，它在床底下。 我们的父母说：“John，进来看看你的房间。你必须学会保持整洁。
